This is my project for the Agents and Interfaces class. 

It is a python game.

My essay will explain some things about the game, the meaning, 
why I chose to do it the way I did.

In this I just wanted to give some quick and Spoiler free Info:

The game has 4 Endings.
Three of them can be found normally in the game.
The forth one is unlocked after you got all other Endings.

I really hope you will take the time to play through the whole thing, 
since that is how I intended it.

Some (but very few parts) might come across as a bit unrefined.
That is simply because they are.
I don't do good with deadlines.

But that should be it.
I hope you enjoy
and even more I hope that everything works.

P.S.:
If you do not have the time to get all the endings, please at least play the finale.
To do so just type 'special' into the menu and press enter.

Thanks
